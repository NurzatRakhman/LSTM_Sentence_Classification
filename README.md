# LSTM_Sentence_Classification 

A LSTM is a modification of Recurrent Neural Networks that can deal with vanishing gradient problem. 
It is a type of artificial neural network that can recognize patterns in sequence of data such as character string, genomes and ext. 

I applied it to classify sentences in multi-class settings.
   The input is a sequence of word's(300) dimensional pre-trained embeddings.     
   The output is a corresponding class category.
